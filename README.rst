Spyral
======

Spyral is a library/engine for developing 2D games in Python, with a focus in rapid development and clean design. Any system that runs Pygame should be able to run Spyral. Instead of ``import pygame``, you'll just use ``import spyral`` instead!

Currently, spyral's main source of documentation comes from docstrings in the source code. Some additional documentation and examples can be found at the Platipy project, which documents Spyral in the context of a university course for which it was developed.
