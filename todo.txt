    * Let Scenes be actors
    * Add sprite.kill
    * Fix clock bug
    * Namespace Memoization
    * Fix color stuff
    * Reinvestigate event sources
    * Styles
    * Add key to keyboard event types
    * Documentation
        - Cameras
    * Unit/Integration Testing
    * Forms
        - Button needs to not have its text dissappear
        - ToggleButtons
        - Checkboxes
        - RadioBoxes
        - A complete example
    spyral.config
        - smoothscale v scale
        - number of frames till static blit caching
    * Mouse Cursor Hiding
    * Keyboard repeating
    * More sensetive input time handling?
    * Investigate behavior with naming keys in events with modifier keys
    * How should sprite.kill work with AggregateSprites? 
    * How about AggregateSprite.remove?
    * Add greenlet to requirements.txt

Documentation:
    * Clarify difference between running animations on sprite (non-blocking, backgrounded) vs actors (blocks the actor for the animation time)

        
    
Platipy:
    Needs an FAQ/Tips & Tricks section:
        - Showcase things like IteratorAnimator
    Needs tutorials on:
        - Layering
        - All of the new sprite properties
        - Cameras
        - Event Recording/Playback
        - Measuring performance
        - Translation/internationalization
 
Example.activity:
    - Add flag for popping into pdb upon crash
    - Saving stack traces into a directory on crashes
    - Uploading stack traces to conspyre
    - Add ability to build other distributions
        - Source, for bundling a source .tar.gz or tar.bz2
        - win, for building an exe on windows
        - xo, for building .xo files for the olpc
        - app, for building OS X .app bundles
        - Debugging versions of all of the above which use different configs
    - Configuration for different launcher profiles
        - XO for on the XOs
        - Release for released versions (exe, app, xo, etc.)
        - Debug for debugging enabled release versions
        - Development for when used by the dev launcher
        Configuration should allow changing
            - Conspyre server
            - Whether to upload stack traces
            - Whether to store stack traces
            - Maybe access to spyral config options
            - Fullscreen or not
            - Framerate cap
            - Profiling output
    - Add Box2D from the Physics.activity
    - Add greenlet binaries for certain platforms
