	Spyral is an open-source project built in Python and intended for use on the OLPC XO laptops to build 2-D games. It was developed on top of the existing library Pygame, but Spyral improves on the concept with a focus on rapid and ease-of-entrance development. It comes standard in any XO laptop, a particular flavor of Linux laptops used in the One Laptop Per Child program, a program that gives a laptop to a child in a developing world when one is purchased through it. 
	Our contribution to the project comes in the form of expanding on Spyrals widget system. Spyral being a development library for video games a robust widget system is quite important. Widgets are arguably one of the more important aspect of a game, especially one that is focused around simplistic development. They’re a simple and versatile way to do anything from in-game notices to an entire user interface.
	Our work was first upgrading the current widget system. Fleshing out the system for hiding and destroying widgets for example. We then began to develop other useful widgets, such as a drop down menu that could be used for a multitude of things. If we were to continue development our goal would be to create a more robust, easy to use widget system and it’s managers.
	In conclusion we believe Spyral is an important project, bringing a fun entry into programming to children that otherwise wouldn’t have access to it. Our work on the project is important to making that goal practical.
